Data and Code for my PhD Project on Analysing Representative Claim-Making by European Commissioners.

The full dataset of Commissioners speeches, representative claims (binary and cound), as well as meta-data is available in final_phd_data_git.

Replication codes are provided for Python in google colab or R.

Until otherwise published, all sub-dataset that I use in my analyses are available from google drive. Please email me for access.
